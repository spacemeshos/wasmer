# Wasmer Libraries

Wasmer is modularized into different libraries, separated into three main sections:

- [Runtime](#runtime)
- [Integrations](#integrations)
- [Backends](#backends)

## Runtime

The core of Wasmer is the runtime, which provides the necessary
abstractions to create a good user experience when embedding.

The runtime is divided into two main libraries:

- [runtime-core](./runtime-core/): The main implementation of the runtime.
- [runtime](./runtime/): Easy-to-use API on top of `runtime-core`.

## Integrations

The integration builds on the Wasmer runtime and allow us to run WebAssembly files compiled for different environments.

Wasmer intends to support different integrations:

- [WASI](./wasi): run WebAssembly files with the [WASI ABI](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/03/standardizing-wasi-a-webassembly-system-interface/).
- [Emscripten](./emscripten): run Emscripten-generated WebAssembly files, such as [Lua](../examples/lua.wasm) or [nginx](../examples/nginx/nginx.wasm).
- **Your own ABI**: Do you want to create your own ABI? Here's a [repo showcasing how](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-rust-customabi-example)!
- Go ABI: _we will work on this soon! Want to give us a hand? âœ‹_
- Blazor: _research period, see [tracking issue](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer/issues/97)_

## Backends

The Wasmer [runtime](./runtime) is designed to support multiple compiler backends, allowing the user
to tune the codegen properties (compile speed, performance, etc) to best fit their use case.

Currently, we support multiple backends for compiling WebAssembly to machine code:

- [singlepass-backend](./singlepass-backend/): Single pass backend - super fast compilation, slower runtime speed
- [clif-backend](./clif-backend/): Cranelift backend - slower compilation, normal runtime speed
- [llvm-backend](./llvm-backend/): LLVM backend - slow compilation, native runtime speed
